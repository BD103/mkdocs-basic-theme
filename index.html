    action and methods match below.

<p>This is a very basic theme for MkDocs with the goal of
demonstrating all of the features with minimal HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>The actual contents of this documentation is very minimal.
Rather, you should look at the .html files in the <code>basic_theme</code>
directory to see the example of the theme.</p>
