# MkDocs Basic Theme

This is a very basic theme for MkDocs with the goal of
demonstrating all of the features with minimal HTML and CSS.

The actual contents of this documentation is very minimal.
Rather, you should look at the .html files in the `basic_theme`
directory to see the example of the theme.
